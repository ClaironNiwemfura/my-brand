                    The Benefits of Technology in Education
                    Technology is embedded into every part of our lives because it provides a wealth of benefits—efficiency, access, connectivity, and personalization, to name a few. The same can be said for the benefits of technology in education when used as a tool for learning and teaching. In today’s blended learning environment, rightsized technology and technology infrastructure can help maximize student learning both in and outside of the classroom and support educators and academic leaders in achieving educational priorities and goals.
                    
                    Benefits of Technology for Educators
                    Primary and secondary school educators are steadfastly dedicated to enabling students—each with individual needs and development paths—with the skill sets and mindsets they need to thrive in life and in today’s technology-driven world. Technology can be used as a powerful tool in education to support educators in achieving their teaching goals.
                    
                    For example, technology-infused active learning experiences can help teachers of any subject for any age develop student social, emotional, and practical skills through the act of completing activities and assignments.
                    
                    Technology can also be used to personalize learning for students. Content and the delivery of that content can be adapted to the needs and learning styles of individual students. Access to real-time student data can help teachers assess student progress, adjust their approach at a class-wide or individual level, or inform recommendations for specific asynchronous learning opportunities.</p>
